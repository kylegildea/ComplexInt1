Given a number A, find the smallest possible value of B+C, if B*C = A. Here A, B, and C must all be positive integers. It's okay to use brute force by checking every possible value of B and C. You don't need to handle inputs larger than six digits. Post the return value for A = 345678 along with your solution.

For instance, given A = 12345 you should return 838. Here's why. There are four different ways to represent 12345 as the product of two positive integers:

12345 = 1*12345
12345 = 3*4115
12345 = 5*2469
12345 = 15*823
The sum of the two factors in each case is:

1*12345 => 1+12345 = 12346
3*4115 => 3+4155 = 4158
5*2469 => 5+2469 = 2474
15*823 => 15+823 = 838
The smallest sum of a pair of factors in this case is 838.
